	<h2>Toyota GR86 - Success or Fail?</h2>

	<p>The traditional <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/best-cars-vans/106907/top-10-best-sports-cars">sports car</a> is being squeezed out of the market, with hot hatchbacks offering performance with practicality on one side, and crossovers and SUVs touting coupe-style rooflines and driveway presence from the other.The <abbr title="Gazoo Racing 86">GR86</abbr> of 2023 is Toyota’s follow-up to the <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/toyota/gt-86"><abbr title="Grand Touring 86">GT86 coupe</abbr></a> that arrived in 2012, and along with refreshed styling, Toyota has used the intervening decade to answer some criticisms of the original car. The GR86 comprehensively answers the first two concerns and goes some way to addressing the latter, but one thing that didn’t need changing was the old car’s sense of fun, and that’s as vivid as ever in the GR86.</p>

		<h2>What GR86 Offers</h2>
		<p>Sadly, <b>no tigers, but with 200hp and a classic front-engine, rear-drive layout, the GR86 has an innate balance.</b> This was just as well at Gurston as the weather proved to be very changeable. <b>Despite this, the rain couldn’t dampen our enthusiasm as each successive practice run and then two competition runs saw our times improve.</b> The GR86 was always able and agile, working with the driver to make the most of the corners and kinks that comprise Gurston Down’s 967-metre course. Even through the fearsome Hollow Bend, the GR86 kept its composure.<br>

			GR86 offers a dynamic and invigorating drive:<br>
			<ol>
				<li><b>GAZOO Racing legacy:</b> The expertise of GAZOO Racing translates to a responsive and agile drive with advanced aerodynamic components.</li>
				<li><b>Pure Driving:</b> The GR86 combines enhanced accelerator response and heightened shift and clutch with an exceptionally lightweight body. The new 2.4 litre engine gives you even more power than its predecessor.</li>
				<li><b>Responsive drive:</b> Lower centre of gravity and increased brake sensitivity create a safer and highly responsive drive.</li>
			</ol>

			The striking looks of the GR86 have been designed with performance in mind:<br>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Aerodynamic design:</b> A wider stance and aerodynamic front air intakes and air outlets create outstanding front-end road-holding. Sleek horizontal side spoilers, and the real wheel arch fins and spoiler improve rear stability.</li>
				<li><b>Building on heritage:</b> The All New GR86 encapsulate characteristics of its ancestors, the GR86 generation builds upon this heritage with high-performance sports tyres, front engine and rear-wheel drive configuration to bring the sleekest model yet.</li>
				<li><b>Exterior design:</b> The GR86 commands the attention an iconic sports car deserves with its eye-catching streamline shaping from every angle. Turn heads wherever you go.</li>
			</ul>

			One user of the car have said:<bdi><b> "لقد مرت ثلاثة أشهر على استخدام سيارة تويوتا GR86، وأنا معجب بمعالجتها الحادة وديناميكيات القيادة المحسنة."</b></bdi> which translates to <b>It has been three months with the Toyota GR86, and I'm impressed with its razor-sharp handling and refined driving dynamics.</b><br>

		<h2>Bad side of GR86?</h2>
		<p>
			Those criticisms included an engine that could feel a little <q><b>torque-light and breathless</b></q>, low-grip tyres that made the car just a little <q><b>too lively</b></q> in some road conditions, and a cabin that always felt a few notches behind its rivals for quality and features. The GR86 comprehensively answers the first two concerns and goes some way to addressing the latter, but one thing that didn’t need changing was the old car’s sense of fun, and that’s as vivid as ever in the GR86.

		Central to the Toyota GR86’s improvements is a <code>larger engine</code>, which brings useful increases in power and torque, and therefore considerably increases the usable performance. The new 2.4-litre flat four is the only engine available in the GR86 and with <code>231bhp and 250Nm</code> of torque, Toyota improved both figures by <code>16 per cent</code>. More importantly, its newfound torque peak is developed much further down the rev range, at 3,700rpm rather than 6,400rpm - so the new motor needs a lot less stoking to deliver its best.<br>

			<p>Toyota was also able to hold the line on pricing as the 2022 GR 86 is slated to start under $30,000 when it goes on sale in November. While some people will undoubtedly whine about the lack of a turbocharged engine, they’re missing the point. The 86 has always been about delivering amazing handling and great driving dynamics.  The GR 86 continues that tradition and enthusiasts can rejoice.</p>
